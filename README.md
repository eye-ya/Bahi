# Bahi
This is my first ever Android "app." I completed Udacity's Android Basics: User Interface project. 
The business I chose was Bahi because I love they products. 
I wish I could have found a way to better place the photos in the center.
I also do not know why there is such a huge gap between the title and the photos.
I can't wait to learn how to make more improvements to the app and make it functional.
